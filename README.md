# Market Risk Analysis Using BiGANs

This notebook provides a practical approach to analyzing market risk using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models, with a focus on **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. GANs, especially Bidirectional GANs (BiGANs), are increasingly valuable in finance for tasks like risk assessment, anomaly detection, and data simulation, offering new ways to evaluate and predict market uncertainties.

## Contents Overview

### 1. Introduction to Market Risk
   - **Market Risk Definition**: Market risk quantifies the potential for financial loss due to fluctuations in asset prices, interest rates, or other market factors.
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - **Value at Risk (VaR)**: A statistical measure estimating the maximum potential loss over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For example, for a 95% confidence level, VaR answers: "What is the maximum loss we expect 95% of the time?"
     - **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Also known as Expected Shortfall, CVaR provides an average of losses beyond the VaR threshold, offering insight into tail risk.

### 2. Data Preparation and Processing
   - To ensure that our models accurately represent market dynamics, we preprocess the data by removing outliers, filling missing values, and normalizing for consistency. 
   - This step is critical, as any anomalies in the data could skew the model, especially when training GANs, which are sensitive to input distributions.

### 3. Introduction to GANs and Why They Matter in Market Risk
   - **What are GANs?** A GAN is composed of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—working in tandem. The generator creates data that resembles the real dataset, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data. This adversarial process helps the generator learn to create highly realistic data.
   - **Why Use GANs?** For market risk, GANs help by generating scenarios that may not appear in historical data, covering a wider range of potential market conditions. This is invaluable in assessing risk by simulating conditions beyond typical historical patterns.

### 4. Why BiGAN?
   - **Introduction to BiGANs**: Unlike traditional GANs, which focus solely on data generation, **Bidirectional GANs (BiGANs)** introduce an encoder that maps real data to a latent space, allowing the model to learn not only how to generate data but also how to represent it. This bidirectional approach enhances representation learning, making BiGANs useful in anomaly detection and unsupervised learning.
   - **Application in Market Risk**: The encoder-decoder framework of BiGANs is especially useful in detecting rare, high-impact events (outliers) that are crucial in financial risk modeling.

### 5. Mathematical Overview
   - **GAN Objective**: The generator (`G`) and discriminator (`D`) have competing objectives, often formulated as a min-max game:

     ```python
     min_G max_D E_x~p_data [log D(x)] + E_z~p_z [log(1 - D(G(z)))]
     ```

   - **BiGAN Extension**: In BiGANs, an encoder (`E`) is added, enabling latent variable inference. The BiGAN objective is modified to:

     ```python
     min_{G,E} max_D E_{x~p_data} [log D(x, E(x))] + E_{z~p_z} [log(1 - D(G(z), z))]
     ```

   - **Value at Risk (VaR)**: For a given confidence level `alpha`, VaR at time horizon `t` is calculated as:

     ```python
     VaR_alpha = inf { loss | P(Loss <= loss) >= alpha }
     ```

   - **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: CVaR, representing the expected tail loss, is defined as:

     ```python
     CVaR_alpha = E[Loss | Loss >= VaR_alpha]
     ```

### 6. Results and Visualizations
   - The notebook includes visual representations of key risk measures, GAN training progress, and model outputs to provide clear insights into market risk and the predictive capabilities of GANs and BiGANs.
